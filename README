This is the README for crosstool-NG

Crosstool-NG follows the autoconf dance. So, to get you
kick-started, just run:
    ./configure --help


Dorimanx Note:
=====================================================================================
To start you will need to build the tool for your machine!

./bootstrap
./configure --enable-local
make

then you will have the tool READY and configured for building

Linaro 14.04 GCC 4.8.3 for LG with ARM and Cortex-a15 CPU neon-vfpv4 hard

the LG set is just a NAME, you can set what ever you need. also the cortex set. 

any way, all can be changed using the config menu

./ct-ng menuconfig

Tool will download all you need! you must have internel connection!

to build do this:

logon to SSH as USER!!! not ROOT! just simple user!

./ct-ng build.32 (thread number = cores x2) is have 16 cores :)


NOW WAIT!!!! :)

My build finish after 25~30MIN without downloading! when rebuilding!

first time build will include downloading about 700~1000MB

so amy take time, just grab some coffee and relax :)

if you want tool to USE new linaro tool chain source, you will need to add it in config folder

vi config/cc/gcc.in

change the:
prompt "linaro-4.8-2014.04" to prompt "linaro-4.8-2014.05"

then the:
default "linaro-4.8-2014.04" if CC_V_linaro_4_8 to default "linaro-4.8-2014.05" if CC_V_linaro_4_8

and when you build again, tool will download the source if it's exist in linaro launch pad page.

have fun and thank me later :)

If you are using a development snapshot, you'll have to
create the configure script, first. Just run:
    ./bootstrap
